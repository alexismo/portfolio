              <h2>A Design Sytem for all devices</h2>
              <p>
                Name an electronic device. Someone probably tried to run a game on it. Games are ubiquitous - an idea which Ubisoft epitomizes. 
                Upon starting this project, it was clear that most current &amp; next-gen devices needed to be supported by this Design System.
                As most games are now played on mobile devices, light & dark modes would need to be included.
                Controller modalities also had to be taken into consideration, meaning that both focus-based navigation 
                (common with game consoles or keyboards) and mouse/touch navigation had to be supported.

                <h2>The challenges feature</h2>
                <p>
                  Developers and designers quickly gained interest in the Design System. All designers were already using the Sketch and Framer libraries
                  we had created for ultra-fast UI design and prototyping.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Developers from other teams who saw value in this Design System started using it and contributing back to it. This was amazing!
                  Very quickly, the number of components available to us was growing due to the positive feedback loop that the team had initiated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In an collaborative decision, the contributors decided to evolve from CSS tokens & shared styles to React.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The move React components empowered designers to bring more types of components to the Design System.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, I worked to automate the creation of icons from Sketch-exported SVGs to  
                  React icon components with customizable 3-tone style.
                </p>

                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
              <h3>3. Tabular expansion</h3>
              <p>Realizing the power the Design System on one hand and some inconsistent pages in our products,
                I rallied designers from each of the major 3 web products from Lightspeed to collaborate on the 
                design and conceptualization of a Table component: arguably the most complex component yet.
              </p>
              <p>To maximize usefulness for all developers, designer and, customers, 
                this Table component would have to support many workflows and modalities. I led interface inventories, competitive
                analyses, and many design workshops with stakeholders in order to get this right.
              </p>
              <p>
                We agreed on a design which supported all of the features the Table should have: 
                <strong>listing</strong>,
                <strong>search</strong>,
                <strong>sorting</strong>,
                <strong>filtering</strong>,
                <strong>summarizing</strong>,
                <strong>paginating</strong>,
                <strong>and more</strong>.
              </p>
              <div class="col-12 center">
                  <figure>
                      <img width="100%" src="images/projects/flame/filterTable.jpg" 
                      srcset="images/projects/flame/filterTable.jpg 1x, images/projects/flame/filterTable@2x.jpg 2x"

                  </figure>
              </div>
              <p>
                To test out assumptions about how the Table would be understood by its users, I built a total of 9 iterations of interactive prototypes 
                for the Table's filtering behaviour. This test was massively successful in identifying the wins and flaws of the table.
              </p>
              <p>Link to the <a href="https://framer.cloud/KHpwX" target="_blank">Framer Table Filtering Prototype</a></p>
              <p>
                As I was building the prototype, I learned how to use anonymous functions with <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>, 
                fetch mock data from the network, optmize rendering, and write modular single-resposibility code.
              </p>
              <p>I am very pleased that the Table is now an integral part of the Design System and in use by all product teams.</p>

            <div class="col-12">
                <h3>4. Birth of a team</h3>
                <p>
                  After a year and a half of building the Design System in a distributed way, I wanted to further increase the velocity and quality of the 
                  Design System. I pitched to key stakeholders the idea that the company should invest in a dedicated team for the Design System.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I put together a presentation outlining the benefits of spending dedicated resources to internal tooling. By attaching a dollar
                  value to the potential benefit of having a dedicated team, I was able to convince senior management to pull together people from existing
                  teams and new hires to form the Design System team. We are (at time of writing) 4 developers and 2 designers. I fall into the latter, and also was bestowed
                  the responsibility of being Product Manager. This has been a huge challenge for me, as I have never received training on how to be a Product Manager.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Hardening and evangelizing</h3>
                <p>
                  With a newfound team and hopeful hearts, the team transitioned from working on the Design System as an "innovation time" project
                  to treating it like a product. Our first initiative was to improve the developer experience of using the Design System. This meant
                  moving from CSS tokens and webpack configs to CSS-in-JS (using styled system) and distributed builds for the React Components. <br />
                  The improvements were significant.<br />
                  From a previously difficult-to-navigate experience which might take a mid-level front-end developer 2 hours to set up, we moved to a way of working
                  that required <i>less than 2 minutes to set up</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The team now offered an easy-to-use solution for installation and usage of our UI components.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gap analysis showed that our stakeholders (designers, developers, product managers, quality specialists) 
                  were being provided with very little guidance as to how, when, and why to use each component. This was to be our 
                  next leap forward as a product. I teamed up with the other designer on the team to design, develop, and launch a comprehensive 
                  documentation site for the Design System to boost <i>understanding and context</i> of the tools we were providing.
                </p>
                <p>After working for about 2 months continuously, the MVP for our site was done. By launch, it contained:
                  <ul style="list-style-type:circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Getting started guide for design and development,</li>
                    <li>Atoms documentation (color, spacing, typography, iconography),</li>
                    <li>Product Content writing guidelines,</li>
                    <li>Component documentation including example usage, copy guidelines, code playground, and API documentation,</li>
                    <li>Pattern documentation for high-level components and component compositions.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <div class="col-12 center">

                </div>
                <p>Creating the site was not enough. Lightspeeders needed to know what it was, why it was good for them, and how to access it.
                  With that in mind, I organized and held 2 "lunch-and-learn" events at Lightspeed offices (in Amsterdam and Montreal) 
                  to properly launch the Design System Documentation website. This launch resulted in a <i>60% increase in visits to the site</i> week-over-week
                  from the previous soft-launch initiatives.
