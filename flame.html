                With a company history wrought with acquisitions from the world over, Lightspeed was ripe for a way to 
                harmonize the divergent styles presented in its products.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Flame design system is a collaborative living set of multidisciplinary tools that helps Lightspeed employees create 
                unified experiences for its customers.

              My contribution to the project was to:
               <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                 <li>produce and evolve the team Sketch shared library,</li>
                 <li>build an ultimately successful business case to management for a dedicated Design Systems team,</li>
                 <li>use an innersource model to facilitate discussions and contributions between siloed teams of >20 front-end and designers,</li>
                 <li>correctly identify, design, and include new components, patterns, and best practices into the Design System,</li>
                 <li>develop the roadmap for the Design System and present this as OKRs to management,</li>
                 <li>design, write, publish, and evangelize a Design System Documentation website.</li>

              At time of writing, Flame is in active use at Lightspeed. It powers <strong>10 teams</strong>, 
              <strong>5 products</strong>, and <strong>30 Lightspeeders</strong> to deliver value to our customers.

              <h2>What was my process?</h2>
              <h3>1. Humble beginnings (CSS)</h3>
              <p>
                Starting in 2016, I noticed that most design work at Lightspeed was inconsistent at many levels. Having worked on a Design System
                previously at EF, I understood how to this problem could be remedied. My first step was to find an allies among the Front-end development
                guild. From there, we explored the idea of building a Design System, and how this might benefit UX Design and Front-end development.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first few components were made from Sketch to CSS tokens. We decided to leverage a small project as a proof-of-concept.
                Getting buy-in from PMs and other developers across the organization was critical: a small time investment up-front in exchange
                for more quality, speed, and consistency in the future.
              </p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <h3>2. Growth & team buy-in (contributions & React)</h3>
                <p>
                  Developers and designers were gaining interest in the Design System. All Designers were already using the Sketch and Framer libraries
                  we had created for ultra-fast UI design and prototyping.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Developers from other teams who saw value in this Design System started using it and contributing back to it. This was amazing!
                  Very quickly, the number of components available to us was growing due to the positive feedback loop that the team had initiated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In an collaborative decision, the contributors decided to evolve the CSS tokens & shared components styles to React.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The move React components empowered designers to bring more types of components to the Design System.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, I worked to automate the creation of icons from Sketch-exported SVGs to  
                  React icon components with customizable 3-tone style.
                </p>

                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
              <h3>3. Tabular expansion</h3>
              <p>Realizing the power the Design System and some lackluster features in some of our products,
                I rallied designers from each of the major 3 web products from Lightspeed in order to collaborate on the 
                design and conceptualization of a Table component: arguably the most complex component we would have.
              </p>
              <p>To be useful for all designers, designer and, most importantly, customers, 
                this Table component would have to support many workflows and modalities. I led interface inventories, competitive
                analyses, and many design workshops with stakeholders in order to get this right.
              </p>
              <p>
                We agreed on a design which supported all of the features the Table should have: 
                <strong>listing</strong>,
                <strong>search</strong>,
                <strong>sorting</strong>,
                <strong>filtering</strong>,
                <strong>summarizing</strong>,
                <strong>paginating</strong>,
                <strong>and more</strong>,
              </p>
              <div class="col-12 center">
                  <figure>
                      <img width="100%" src="images/projects/flame/filterTable.jpg" 
                      srcset="images/projects/flame/filterTable.jpg 1x, images/projects/flame/filterTable@2x.jpg 2x" 
                      alt="Filter Table from the Flame Design System" />

                          Filter Table from the Flame Design System

                  </figure>
              </div>
              <p>
                Moreover, I built a total of s9 interactive prototypes for the Table's filtering behaviour in order to test out assumptions
                about how the Table could be used. This test was massively successful in identifying the wins and flaws of the table.
              </p>
              <p>Link to the <a href="https://framer.cloud/KHpwX" target="_blank">Framer Table Filtering Prototype</a></p>
              <p>
                During this process of building the prototype, I learned how to use <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> functions, 
                fetch mock data from the network, optmize rendering, and write modular single-resposibility code.
              </p>
              <p>I am very pleased that the Table is now an integral part of the Design System and in use by all product teams.</p>

                <h3>4. Birth of a team</h3>
                <p>
                  After a year and a half of building the Design System in a distributed way, I suggested to some key stakeholders
                  that we should make a push to further increase the velocity of the Design System.
