            With a company history rich with acquisitions from the world over,
            Lightspeed was ripe for a way to harmonize the divergent styles
            presented in its products.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Flame design system is a collaborative living set of
            multidisciplinary tools that helps Lightspeeders create unified
            experiences for its customers.

            <li>produce and evolve the team Sketch shared library,</li>
            <li>
              use an innersource model to facilitate contributions and
              discussions between siloed teams of &gt;20 front-end and

          <h2>How did this happen? What was my process?</h2>
          <h3>1. Humble beginnings (CSS)</h3>
          <p>
            Starting in 2016, I noticed that most design work at Lightspeed was
            inconsistent at many levels. Having worked on a Design System
            previously at EF, I understood how to this problem could be
            remedied. My first step was to find allies among the Front-end
            development guild. Together, we explored the idea of building a
            Design System, and how this might benefit UX Design and Front-end
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first few components were made of CSS classes. We decided to
            leverage a small project as a proof-of-concept. Getting buy-in from
            PMs and other developers across the organization was critical: a
            small time investment up-front in exchange for more quality, speed,
            and consistency in the future.

        <h3>2. Growth & team buy-in (contributions & React)</h3>
        <p>
          Developers and designers quickly gained interest in the Design System.
          All designers were already using the Sketch and Framer libraries we
          had created for ultra-fast UI design and prototyping.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developers from other teams who saw value in this Design System
          started using it and contributing back to it. This was amazing! Very
          quickly, the number of components available to us was growing due to
          the positive feedback loop that the team had initiated.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a collaborative decision, the contributors decided to evolve from
          CSS tokens & shared styles to React.
        </p>
        <p>
          The move to React components empowered designers to bring more types
          of components to the Design System.

        <h3>3. Tabular expansion</h3>
        <p>
          Realizing the power of the Design System on one hand and some
          inconsistent pages in our products, I rallied designers from each of
          the major 3 web products from Lightspeed to collaborate on the design
          and conceptualization of a Table component: arguably the most complex
          component yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          To maximize usefulness for all developers, designers, and customers,
          this Table component would have to support many workflows and
          modalities. I led interface inventories, competitive analyses, and
          many design workshops with stakeholders in order to get this right.

        <h3>4. Birth of a team</h3>
        <p>
          After a year and a half of building the Design System in a distributed
          way, I wanted to further increase the velocity and quality of the
          Design System. I pitched to key stakeholders the idea that the company
          should invest in a dedicated team for the Design System.

          With a newfound team and hopeful hearts, the team transitioned from
          working on the Design System as an "innovation time" project to
          treating it like a product. Our first initiative was to improve the
          developer experience of using the Design System.
