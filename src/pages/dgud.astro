      <h2>EF DGUD</h2>

      <h3>DGUD Manifesto</h3>
      <p>
        The dGUD style guide is meant to help designers build great interfaces
        reducing the time spent on exploration or conceptualization of a visual
        identity. While we understand certain areas of the school deserve more
        prominence and visual/functional identity, we believe it's in good
        effort to offer other designers across the company a set of assets and
        components that have been carefully crafted, with rigorous emphasis on
        simplicity, hierarchy, typography, spacing and color.

      <p>
        To better suit a mobile form factor and the context of our students, our
        team devised ways to break down existing web content into smaller,
        bite-sized morcels of learning.

        The goal of this project was to leverage the existing English Live
        platform on desktop Web and rethink the design and interaction patterns
        of the e-learning templates in a way better suited to mobile platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>My involvement</strong> was to rethink these interactions and create
        wireframes and interactive prototypes for more than 10 activity templates.
        Expanding beyond the original scope of the project, I also designed some activity
        templates unique to mobile.
