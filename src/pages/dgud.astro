            An acronym for "Digital Grand Unified Design", DGUD is a Design
            System powering Education First's online identity for its English
            Live Product offering: Web, Classroom, iPad, iOS Mobile &amp;
            Android.

        <p>
          The dGUD style guide is meant to help designers build great interfaces
          reducing the time spent on exploration or conceptualization of a
          visual identity. While we understand certain areas of the school
          deserve more prominence and visual/functional identity, we believe
          it's in good effort to offer other designers across the company a set
          of assets and components that have been carefully crafted, with
          rigorous emphasis on simplicity, hierarchy, typography, spacing and
          color.

          To better suit a mobile form factor and the context of our students,
          our team devised ways to break down existing web content into smaller,
          bite-sized morcels of learning.

          The goal of this project was to leverage the existing English Live
          platform on desktop Web and rethink the design and interaction
          patterns of the e-learning templates in a way better suited to mobile
          platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>My involvement</strong> was to rethink these interactions and create
          wireframes and interactive prototypes for more than 10 activity templates.
          Expanding beyond the original scope of the project, I also designed some
          activity templates unique to mobile.
