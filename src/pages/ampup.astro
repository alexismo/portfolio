          JBL is a ubiquitous brand in many countries. Alongside Industrial and
          UI designers, I worked within the Industrial Design team at Harman
          International in Shenzhen China to take a first stab at the app
          landscape relevant for a brand like JBL. Over the course of 4 months,
          I designed 2 iPad &amp; iPhone applications and coached 2 visual
          designers into crafting modern (at the time) visuals.

          JBL AmpUp was available on the Apple App Store in 2011. It has since
          been discontinued.
